Introduction to Digital Logic

Labs:
1. Using Quartus Prime and the DE2 FPGA board – AND gates, OR gates, XOR gates, half Adder,
Full Adder
2. ModelSim and VHDL – Simulate gates and duplicate Lab 1 gates using VHDL
3. Encoders and Decoders
4. Latches and Flip-flops
5. Counters
6. The Audio synthesizer (sound generation) – Uses decoders, adders, flip-flops and a ROM based
sine wave to select different tones to be presented to the Audio CODEC
7. Simon game state machine Part 1 – Combines lighted pushbuttons, debouncing circuits, and
audio synthesizer to implement the Simon game.
8. Simon game state machine Part 2 – Uses a state machine design in VHDL to implement the fully
functional Simon game.
